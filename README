SSH-Matic 0.1.1 alpha

This script is meant to automate the repetitive tasks of connecting to some remote SSH
hosts and invoking some commands as simple as possible.

The only thing you need to do is to customize list of servers to provide their IP numbers
and usernames, plus to give the absolute path to your private (not password-protected)
SSH key. Path can be also realtive to the directory from which the script will be invoked.

Default command in version 0.1.1 is to make 'git pull' on the 'public_html' subdirectory.
You may wish to change it.
